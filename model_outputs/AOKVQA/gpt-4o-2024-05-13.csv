1. **Uniforms and Equipment**: The uniforms and equipment are professional but not at the level typically seen in major or minor league baseball. College teams often have high-quality gear, but it is usually distinct from the professional leagues.

2. **Dugout and Field**: The dugout and field setup is more consistent with college-level facilities. Major and minor league fields tend to have more elaborate and larger dugouts and stadiums.

3. **Team Composition**: The number of players and the way they are dressed (some in full uniform, some in warm-ups) is typical of college teams, where there is a mix of starters and reserves present in the dugout.

4. **Logos and Branding**: The uniforms have logos and branding that are often associated with college teams, which typically feature the school's initials or mascot prominently.
